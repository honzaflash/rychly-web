# xrychly-web
This is what used to be a private repo of my (public lol) university web page
when I was a student at FI MUNI.

Every student could set up their page that was hosted on the faculty servers. The current version is hosted by GitHub Pages.

It serves as a way for me to share some of my web related work and skills.
